ECA 5.5 Notes

Day 1
+++++
Super converged vs hyper converged, diff is network
what is the cloud, topics to cover infra services - file block computer
integrated data services - dp / ha
platform services db big data analytics

What is hyper converged
-----------------------

x86 based storage and compute resources
software based sys intel
vit
management
api based automation and rich analytics
..... into a single scalable solution

Covered dell ibm lenovo briefly showing pictures

Discuss diff between node / block / cluster
Covered SED's does a good job of covering this, goes over why sed's differences between, covers compliance, how disk io controller on drive
covers the encryption so no overhead

****Find encryption overhead for software****  This was unknown

Cluster example
---------------

joining multiple nodes in a cluster allows for pooling of resources
storage is presented as a single pool via the controller vm (cvm)
Covers data path from start to finish and covers rdma and ahv turbo  (we should prob have a nustuff or demo for this)

Software only
-------------

covers prism pro features, xfit vm write sizing capacity runway, multiple cluster upgrades etc
covers calm elevator speech
Goes over calm value, describes calm and benefits
goes over acropolys features 
Covers write acknowledgements with rf2 and rf3 and metro, covers metro can be rf2 or rf3 regardless of src
shows all prism licenses 

Storage Pool
------------
covers the different storage pieces, does a great job going over lacking storage vmotion and how to battle that.

AHV
---

hardened enterprise grade hypervisor based on proven open source tech
hypvervisor features - vm networking host profiles rolling upgrades sotrage conf host maint mode
vm features - intelligent placement live migration converged dr / backup image management vmoperations analytics data path optimization 

app mobility fabric

ha  cross hypervisor dr one click hypervisor conversion

covers support portal and what to find, ref architecture best practices kbs etc
